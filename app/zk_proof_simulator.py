# VERA AI - SPRINT 3, TASK 3.1: ZK-PROOF SIMULATOR

    Simulates generating a ZK-proof for a given analysis report.

    In a real system, this would involve a complex cryptographic process using
    a tool like Cairo's Starknet Prover.

    For our MVP, we simulate this by:
    1. Creating a stable, ordered string representation of the report.
    2. Hashing that string using a standard algorithm (SHA-256).
    3. Returning a "proof object" containing the hash and other metadata.

    Args:
        report (dict): The final analysis report generated by the AI.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary containing the mock proof hash and related info.
